# What is Ethereum
# Ethereum Basics ✅
- ✅ Faucet
- ✅ Etherscan - block explorer
- ✅ Fee and gas
- ✅ Two type of accounts: Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and Contracts
- ✅ Wallets: MetaMask, Jaxx, MyEtherWallet and Emerald Wallet
# Ethereum Clients 
# Cryptography
# Wallets ✅
- ✅ Nondeterministic (Random) Wallets
- ✅ Deterministic (Seeded) Wallets
- ✅ Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets (BIP-32/BIP-44)
- ✅ Seeds and Mnemonic Codes (BIP-39
# Transactions✅
- ✅ Why do we need 'nonce'?
- ✅ Why do we need 'signature'?
- ✅ Address for burning ether - 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD
- ✅ Address for creating contract - 0x0
- ✅ Offline Signing
- ✅ Multiple-Signature (Multisig) Transactions

# Smart Contracts and Security
- ✅ Security Best Practices
  - Minimalism/simplicity
  - Code reuse - DRY
  - Code quality - OpenZepplin
  - Readability/auditability
  - Test coverage
- ✅ Security Risks and Antipatterns
- ✅ Reentrancy
- ✅ Arithmetic Over/Underflows
- Unexpected Ether
- DELEGATECALL
- ✅ Default Visibilities
- ✅ Entropy Illusion
- ✅ External Contract Referencing
- ✅ Short Address/Parameter Attack (without real example)
- ✅ Unchecked CALL Return Values
- ✅ Race Conditions/Front Running
- ✅ Denial of Service (DoS)
- Block Timestamp Manipulation
- ✅ Constructors with Care (why contructor was changed)

- ✅ Floating Point and Precision
- ✅ Tx.Origin Authentication
- ✅ Contract Libraries
- ✅ Conclusions
# Tokens ✅
# Oracles ✅
- ✅ The three main ways to set up an oracle can be categorized as request–response, publish-subscribe, and immediate-read.
