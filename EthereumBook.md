# What is Ethereum ✅
Ethereum’s purpose is not primarily to be a digital currency payment network. While the digital currency ether is both integral to and necessary for the operation of Ethereum, ether is intended as a utility currency to pay for use of the Ethereum platform as the world computer
- ✅ P2P
- ✅ Transaction
- ✅ Consensus alogrithm
- ✅ The Birth of Ethereum
- ✅ Ethereum’s Four Stages of Development: Frontier, Homestead, Metropolis, and Serenity. The intermediate hard forks that have occurred (or are planned) to date are codenamed Ice Age, DAO, Tangerine Whistle, Spurious Dragon, Byzantium, and Constantinople.
- ✅ Ethereum: A General-Purpose Blockchain - world wide computer (EVM)
- ✅ Ethereum’s Components: P2P network, Consensus rules, Transactions, State machine, Data structures, Consensus algorithm, Economic security, Clients
- ✅ Ethereum and Turing Completeness: Turing Completeness as a “Feature”
- ✅ From General-Purpose Blockchains to Decentralized Applications (0xD0Apps): A decentralized (P2P) storage protocol and platform, A decentralized (P2P) messaging protocol and platform
- ✅ The Third Age of the Internet
- ✅ Ethereum’s Development Culture - fast
# Ethereum Basics ✅
- ✅ Faucet
- ✅ Etherscan - block explorer
- ✅ Fee and gas
- ✅ Two type of accounts: Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and Contracts
- ✅ Wallets: MetaMask, Jaxx, MyEtherWallet and Emerald Wallet
# Ethereum Clients  ✅
- ✅ Clients: Parity (written in Rust), Geth (written in Go), cpp-ethereum (written in C++), pyethereum (written in Python), Mantis (written in Scala), Harmony (written in Java)
- ✅ Full Node, Remote client ~= wallet
- ✅ JSON-RPC Interface
- ✅ Remote client provides the ability to do one or more of the following:
  - Manage private keys and Ethereum addresses in a wallet.
  - Create, sign, and broadcast transactions.
  - Interact with smart contracts, using the data payload.
  - Browse and interact with DApps.
  - Offer links to external services such as block explorers.
  - Convert ether units and retrieve exchange rates from external sources.
  - Inject a web3 instance into the web browser as a JavaScript object.
  - Use a web3 instance provided/injected into the browser by another client.
  - Access RPC services on a local or remote Ethereum node.

# Cryptography ✅
- ✅ Asymmetric cryptography: Private Keys and Public Keys
- ✅ Hash algorithm: Keccak-256, SHA-256
- ✅ Elliptic Curve Cryptography: secp256k1
- ✅ Public key (address): 0x04 - Uncompressed point - 65
- ✅ Cryptographic Hash Functions: Determinism, Verifiability, Noncorrelation, Irreversibility, Collision protection
- ✅ Where we can use hash functions: Data fingerprinting, Message integrity (error detection), Proof of work, Authentication (password hashing and key stretching), Pseudorandom number generators,  Message commitment (commit–reveal mechanisms), Unique identifiers
- 📯✅ Ethereum addresses: Inter Exchange Client Address Protocol, Checksum
# Wallets ✅
- ✅ Nondeterministic (Random) Wallets
- ✅ Deterministic (Seeded) Wallets
- ✅ Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets (BIP-32/BIP-44)
- ✅ Seeds and Mnemonic Codes (BIP-39
# Transactions✅
- ✅ Why do we need 'nonce'?
- ✅ Why do we need 'signature'?
- ✅ Address for burning ether - 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD
- ✅ Address for creating contract - 0x0
- ✅ Offline Signing
- ✅ Multiple-Signature (Multisig) Transactions

- Wallet
Software that holds secret keys. Used to access and control Ethereum accounts and interact with smart contracts. Keys need not be stored in a wallet, and can instead be retrieved from offline storage (e.g., a memory card or paper) for improved security. Despite the name, wallets never store the actual coins or tokens.
